The Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise and Hare) pattern is used to detect cycles in linked lists and other similar structures.

Sample Problem:
Detect if a linked list has a cycle.

Explanation:
- Initialize two pointers, one moving one step at a time (slow) and the other moving two steps at a time (fast).
- If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
- If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, there is no cycle.
