# The Unix philosophy in a nutshell
- Everything is a process; if it's not a process, it's a file
A process is an instance of a program in execution
- One tool to do one task
- Three standard I/O channel
- Combine tools seamlessly
- Plain text preferred
- CLI, not GUI
- Modular, designed to be repurposed by others
- Provide the mechanism, not the policy
