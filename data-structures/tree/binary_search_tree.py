# Binary search tree is a data structure that quickly allows us to maintain a sorted list of numbers.
# It is called a binary tree because each tree node has a maximum of two children.
# It is called a search tree because it can be used to search for the presence of a number in O(log(n)) time.
# 
# The properties that separate a binary search tree from a regular binary tree is
# All nodes of left subtree are less than the root node
# All nodes of right subtree are more than the root node
# Both subtrees of each node are also BSTs i.e. they have the above two properties
